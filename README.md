# Stategraph—evented data structure for untangling state! [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/munro/stategraph.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/munro/stategraph)

Stategraphs are a great tool for managing state, it can be used to simplify
things such as game logic, or UI flow.  This library provides evented states,
and nested graphing!  Woah!

Couple this library with [Slots](https://github.com/munro/slots) for a
path of destruction!  Allowing you to easily clean up bound events when leaving
a state.  Try using [`emitter.removeListener(event, listener)`](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_removelistener_event_listener)
if you don't believe me! :)

## Documentation

### Constructing

To begin using stategraph, simply require it, and instantiate an object!

```javascript
var StateGraph = require('stategraph');

var graph = new StateGraph();
```

You can also extend the prototype; using plain old prototypal OOP, or with your
favorite OOP sugar, such as [Self](https://github.com/munro/self).

```javascript
function Game() {
    StateGraph.call(this);

    // `this` is now a stategraph!
}
Game.prototype = Object.create(StateGraph.prototype);
```

### State creation & movement

To create `State` nodes in your graph, call the
`.state(String name, Function callback)` method with the name of the state, and
a callback to run when the graph has entered that state.  The first argument of
the callback is the `State` node.  So you may attach state to that variable, and
it will still be there when you come back!

```javascript
graph.state('home', function (home) {
    assertTrue(home === this);

    home.count = (home.count || 0) + 1;
});
```

To move between nodes, call the `.go(String name)` method with the name of the
state.

```javascript
graph.go('home');
```

You can also call `.go(String name, args...)` with extra arguments that will be
passed to the state callback.

```javascript
graph.state('game', function (game, players, map) {
    game.players = players;
});

graph.go('game', ['player 1', 'player 2'], 'some_map');
```

When you're all done with your graph, you can end it by calling `.end()`.
Though the graph can be started back up at any time with `.go(String name)`.

```javascript
graph.end();
```

### Evented state

When the graph leaves a state, you can bind a callback to the state's `end`
event.  Like the state callback, the first argument of the `end` event is
the `State` object.

```javascript
graph.state('hello', function (hello) {
    end.timer = setTimeout(function () {
        alert('Hello world!');
    }, 1000);
}).on('leave', function (hello) {
    // Let's remove the trigger if the graph leaves the state before it
    // triggers.
    clearTimeout(hello.timer);
});
```

You can also create & bind your own custom events.

```javascript
graph.state('world', function (world) {
    world.emit('test', 'just because');
}).on('test', function (message) {
    alert('testing ' + message); // testing just because
});
```

### Nested state

To nest state, simply call the `state` method with a list of states you would
like to define.  Sub‑states will be entered with the entire list of state
objects at the head of the arguments, so you can access any parent state.

```javascript
graph.state('lobby', function (lobby) {
    // players can chat
});

graph.state('lobby', 'host', function (lobby, host) {
    // host can kick
});

graph.state('lobby', 'player', function (lobby, player) {
    // can't do anything other than chat
});
```

To move about nested graphs, you can use the `.go(String name)` method to go to
the lobby state, which returns the lobby `State` object (which is now also a
`StateGraph`!)  So you can chain your nested graphs by calling `go` again!

```javascript
graph.go('lobby').go('host', args...);
```

The other way is to return the sub‑state you desire to move to—and call the
`jump` command on that state.  The `jump` command will backtrace the nested
graphs and move to the correct parent states, but keep in mind no arguments will
be used when moving to parent states.

```javascript
graph.state('lobby', 'player').jump(args...);
```

## API

* `StateGraph`
    * `state(String name..., Function callback) → State` — Define a state with a
        callback to be called when entered.  Remember the `State` context is the
        first argument of the callback!  This function returns the newly created
        `State` object.
    * `state(String name...) → State` — Return the `State`, or sub‑`State`
        object by name
    * `state() → State` — Return the current state.
    * `go(String name[, args...]) → State` — Switch states, passing any args to
        the state callback.  Returns the newly entered state.
    * `end()` — Leave the current state, ending the graph.  The graph can be
        reentered at any time!

* `State`
    * Inherits [events.EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter)
    * Lazily inherits `StateGraph` when the `state` method is called.
        * `jump([args...])` — Jump to this state with a list of arguments,
            recursively moving to the correct state for the parent graphs.
    * Events
        * `enter` — Triggered when the graph enters this state, any arguments
            used to move to this state are avaliable after the list of states.
        * `leave` — Triggered when the graph leaves this state.  The head of
            the arguments are the parent `State` objects.

## Example

It is very useful to use a stategraph when handling the state of a user!  For
security purposes, you don't want to user to be able to trigger events when
they're not in that state.

For example, if you have a game where only hosts can kick other players, you
don't want a user to trigger the kick event if they're not a host!  So instead
of having a state check at the beginning of your events, you can simply remove
them!

```javascript
graph.on('host', function (host) {
    // Give host ability to kick
    host.on_kick = function (other_player) {
        game.kick(other_player);
    };
    player.on('kick', host.on_kick);
}).on('leave', function (host) {
    // No more kick for you!
    player.removeListener('kick', host.on_kick);
});

graph.on('player', function (player) {
    // Poor player can't do anything!
});
```
